What if we want to link to a specific Friend's page when we click on their name?

Let's wrap it in a Link, which gives it the ability to respond to a click without the onClick method 

Link takes a string and puts it in the top and finds the route you want to go to 
We'll need to wrap in {} and `` to use interpolation in the Link string 

Since we want that very specific friend we'll use...

link.com/friends/id is what we're going for...

export default (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Id: {props.id}</p>
            <Link to="{`/friends/${props.id}`}">
            <p>Name: {props.name}<p>
        </div>
    )
}

Now we've made truly dynamic routing.

As we click, it will go specifically to the page of link.com/friends/1 or link.com/friends/3, depending on their id 
It detects our props.id and loads that specific profile page

In this example, it's not terribly useful because it doesn't show extra information, but this gives us an idea of how we can make it ever better and more dynamic.

Don't forget to still use preventDefault on anything that typically reloads a page (like form or anchor tags)
